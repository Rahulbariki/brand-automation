# Deployment Guide

This project is designed to be deployed as two separate services:
1. **Backend**: Python FastAPI application deployed on Render.
2. **Frontend**: Static HTML/JS application deployed on Vercel.

---

## 🏗️ Backend Deployment (Render)

The backend is containerized using Docker.

1. **Push your code to GitHub/GitLab**.
2. **Create a New Web Service on Render**:
   - **Root Directory**: `.` (Root) or `backend` if you want to be specific, but for Docker it usually uses the root context.
   - The `render.yaml` sets the build context to `.` so keep Root Directory as repo root.

3. **Database Setup**:
   - The `render.yaml` includes a PostgreSQL database definition (`bizforge-db`).
   - Render will automatically create this database and provide a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to your web service.

4. **Environment Variables**:
   The following variables are defined in `render.yaml` or need to be set in the Render Dashboard:

   | Variable | Description |
   | :--- | :--- |
   | `DATABASE_URL` | Auto-set by Render (Internal Connection String). |
   | `SECRET_KEY` | Auto-generated by Render. |
   | `GROQ_API_KEY` | **Required**. Get this from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/). |
   | `IBM_MODEL` | Defaults to `ibm-granite/granite-3.0-2b-instruct`. |
   | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | **Optional**. For payments. |
   | `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | **Optional**. For payments. |
   | `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | **Optional**. For Google Auth. |

5. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Create Web Service".
   - Wait for the build to finish.
   - Once deployed, copy your **Backend URL** (e.g., `https://bizforge-api.onrender.com`).

### ⚡ Vercel Deployment (Universal)

The project is also optimized for a single-command deployment to Vercel (Backend + React Frontend).

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download) installed.
2. **Setup Project ID**: I have already added `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` to your `.env`.
3. **Deployment**:
   Run the following in your terminal:
   ```bash
   vercel link --project prj_0GY4RxdFE4WyDPLb8TbJ8dJnHDnp
   vercel deploy --prod
   ```
4. **Configuration**:
   - The `vercel.json` in the root directory manages both the Python API (`api/index.py`) and the React frontend (`brandnova-ui`).
   - Environment variables (Groq, HF, Supabase, etc.) must be set in the Vercel Dashboard under **Project Settings > Environment Variables**.

## 🔄 Verification

1. Open your Vercel URL.
2. Open the Browser Console (F12).
3. Try to Log In or Sign Up.
4. Check the Network tab to ensure requests are hitting your Render Backend URL (not localhost or the placeholder).
